Layers is a minimal browser-based encryption protocol that adds an extra client-side layer to existing messaging platforms.

All encryption and decryption happens locally in the browser.
There is no server-side processing, no accounts, and no data collection.

This project is intentionally simple.

The goal is not to provide military-grade cryptography or compete with established security libraries.
The goal is to introduce deliberate friction and local control into everyday communication.

Layers is a reference implementation of a design principle:
Automation scales. Human intent does not.

Development is intentionally slow and minimal.
The system prioritizes clarity and accessibility over feature expansion.

Use it. Inspect it. Fork it if you wish.
